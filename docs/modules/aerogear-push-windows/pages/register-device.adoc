== The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server


With all the Windows Setup work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to WNS for a later message sending.

:pushplatform: Windows

In the link:/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#_the_wizard[Wizard] after you create a PushApplication, click the **Add Variant** button and fill out the Windows options. You will want to use the **Package SID** and **Client Secret** from the *Windows Dev Center* in their appropriate fields:

Afterwards you will see some code snippets, containing the **Variant ID** and **Secret**, that you can use in your Windows application for the registration of the device, running your app:

=== Visual Studio

The server is now configured. Let's move to Visual Studio and link:#windows-app[create an Windows application] that will use the AeroGear Windows library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
