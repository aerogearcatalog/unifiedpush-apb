== Send a Push Notification


Now that we have the sample application running, it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message.

=== Simple Sender

Login to the administration console of the UnifiedPush server and click on the "Send Notification" button on the desired PushApplication and write a message in the text field. Once done, hit the 'Send Push Notification'.

If all goes well, you should see the message payload being displayed on screen:

Now click the 'Home' button to return to Home Screen and send another push message. You should see the notification being displayed in the Notification Manager:

If you want to go to a specific page when the application is brought back into the foreground you can add a page parameter into the message:

```json
"message": {
    "windows": {
      "page": "/YourPage.xaml"
      ...
    }
}
```

=== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending and receiving _Push Notifications_ for Windows.
