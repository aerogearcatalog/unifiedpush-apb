== SimplePush Primer

SimplePush protocol is Mozilla's new emerging standard for push notifications, conceptually based on link:http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/37474.pdf[Thialfi], Google's own highly scalable notification service. Introduced first in Firefox OS, there are plans to bring support to it on desktop and mobile browsers as well. The primary goal of the protocol, as stated in the link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol[SimplePush specification] is:

_"To notify clients of changes to application server state in a reliable manner by ensuring that the client will always eventually learn of the latest version of an object for which it has expressed interest."_

If you closely read the definition, one important fact arises. By the use of words 'notify' and 'eventually learn', the spec upfront _suggests_ that the system is designed for data-signaling  and not be used for data carrying. Once the client is notified for a change in the server state, the client may choose to connect to the server and obtain the most 'recent version' of the object. That is in pair with how mobile notifications systems work, where the notification is used as a method of signaling instead of carrying the message.

The protocol involves three components. A server component (the _SimplePush_ server), responsible for pushing notification to web clients upon a change, a client component, a JavaScript API provided by the browser for web developers to use to register with the server and attach notification callbacks, and a third component, your application server (JBoss etc) where your backend application is running and changes in object state occur. The protocol utilizes WebSockets for real-time communication between the browser clients and the SimplePush server.


=== SimplePush Workflow

Let's examine how the SimplePush protocol works with the aid of an example. A user ''Joe'' uses an online web forum application and wants to be notified when a new post is created on a topic he has expressed interest. To accomplish that, the application using the JS API, registers with a SimplePush server the 'channel' is interested in (here the topic name). The server replies with an 'endpoint' URL. The client then sends the endpoint to the 3rd party application server. Now, when a change in state occurs, the application server simply does an HTTP PUT on the endpoint URL informing the SimplePush server that a notification should be sent to client. The HTTP PUT payload contains a 'version' number of the object that is keep increasing every time the application server updates the endpoint. Once the notification is received, the client triggers a request against the application server to request the updated state (e.g. the new post). 

[NOTE]
The client did _not_ receive the data of the new post; instead it received a notification that it could fetch the latest data.

The following diagram visually describes the workflow:

Primary advantages of using SimplePush are:

* offloads the client to continuously poll your application server for changes in state.
* offloads your application server for notification delivery and handling. It simply does a simple HTTP PUT on an endpoint when change in state occurs.
* The SimplePush server is designed to be highly efficient in notification delivery as well as gracefully handle communication failures, server crashes etc. No need to start from scratch!

=== SimplePush JavaScript API

The API is straightforward to use and consists of two parts, registration of the channels with the SimplePush server and attaching a callback called when a notification is received.

_Registration on the SimplePush server:_
[source,javascript]
----
// register to receive notification updates for new posts in a fiction forum called 'tech'
var req = navigator.push.register();  // [1]
req.onsuccess = function() {
  var endpoint = req.result;
  // if it is the first registration need to post the
  // received update endpoint to your application server.
  if (endpoint.pushEndpoint)
     $.post('/registrations/forums/tech/', { endpoint: endpoint.pushEndpoint })
}
----

_Receiving push notifications:_
[source,javascript]
----
navigator.setMessageHandler( "push", function( message ) {
  // --notification received--
  // 'message.channelID' contains the ID of the channel
  // 'message.version' contains the version of the object

  // contact the application server to receive the latest updates e.g.
  $.get("/forums/tech", function(data) {
    // data should contains the latest posts
  });
----

Further, if you want to see how SimplePush can be used under link:http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/[Firefox OS], Mozilla has written a detailed article and can be found in link:https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/dont-miss-out-on-the-real-time-fun-use-firefox-os-push-notifications/[here].

=== AeroGear SimplePush JavaScript API
Currently the SimplePush API is supported only in Firefox OS v1.1 and in custom builds of Firefox. AeroGear already provides a polyfill library that can support other browsers as well. It leverages link:https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client[SockJS] on the client and on the server to ensure maximum transport compatibility e.g. for older browsers that lack websocket support.

You can find more information on AeroGear SimplePush JavaScript API on our link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-simplepush-quickstart[SimplePush quickstart]. This guide leverages that example and enchances to support registration with the UnifiedPush server. Now once a notification is received in the UnifiedPush server, it will forward to the SimplePush server which will in turn push it to all registered SimplePush clients.

In the link:#simplepush-server[next section] we will have a brief look at the second component of the SimplePush, the SimplePush server.
