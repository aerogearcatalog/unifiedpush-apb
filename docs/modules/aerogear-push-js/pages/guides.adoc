The [AeroGear UnifiedPush](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server.git) server apart from providing support on pushing notifications to different mobile platforms (called _Variants_), it also supports pushing notifications to Web clients too. It includes [SimplePush protocol](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol) support, Mozilla's new emerging standard for push notifications, integrated into the server as another supported _Variant_. 

The following step-by-step guides, will briefly introduce you to the concepts of SimplePush itself, howto setup the AeroGear SimplePush and UnifiedPush servers, and with the help of an example we will show you how to send notification messages to your web applications.
