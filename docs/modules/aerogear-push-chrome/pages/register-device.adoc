== The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server

Now that all the Google work is done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to CGM for sending messages later in the tutorial.

=== AeroGear UnifiedPush Server

The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ defines a logical _abstraction_ for Mobile Applications that have support for different Push Networks. Its _Push Applications_ can have different "Variants". For this tutorial we'll need to create a _Push Application_ which will contain one Chrome Packaged App Variant.

Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed link:../../ups_userguide/index/[here].

Once you have run through the link:../../ups_userguide/index/#server-installation[Installation] and link:../../ups_userguide/index/#_login_and_landing_page[Login] Procedures, meet me back here.  I'll wait.

Ok, now that your back, lets continue.

For the purpose of the guide, we will be using the AdminUI and assuming that you have followed the previous guide to login and setup your UnifiedPush Server environment.

You may be wondering why we are creating an Android Variant for a Chrome app.  Well, the previous link:https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pushMessaging[chrome.pushMessaging API] has been deprecated since chrome 38 and will be removed soon.  This has been replaced with the link:https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/gcm[chrome.gcm API], which uses the same GCM as Android.  This allows us to use the Android Variant for Chrome Apps!!

Click the **Add Variant** button. And fill out the Android options.  You will want to use the **Client ID** and **Project Number** from the *Google API Console* in their appropriate fields.

Click **Add** and your variant will be created.

Expand the variant card and make note of the **Variant ID** and **Secret** fields. Both will be used later when registering your installation through the Android client SDK.

The server is now configured. Time to link:#chrome-app[create a Chrome Packaged Application] that will use the AeroGear JS library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
